yt-dlg is a graphical user interface (GUI) for youtube-dl, which means it provides a more user-friendly and interactive way of using the command-line tool[¹][1]. Some advantages of using yt-dlg over youtube-dl are:

- You can store channel name, video name, youtube ID and other information in the title[¹][1].
- You can monitor the progress and status of your downloads in a graphical window[¹][1].
- You can easily access and change the options and settings of youtube-dl[¹][1].
- You can use yt-dlp as the backend, which is a fork of youtube-dl that has more features and updates[²][2] [³][3]
